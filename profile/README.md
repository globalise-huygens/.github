## GLOBALISE

The [GLOBALISE project](https://globalise.huygens.knaw.nl) is 
an innovative and interdisciplinary project that aims to unlock the key series of documents and reports in the archives of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) for advanced new research methods. Its goal is to create an infrastructure that facilitates research into the series of _Overgekomen Brieven en Papieren_ (OBP).[^1] This series contains handwritten copies of reports, letters and other documents from VOC offices in many different locations in Asia, dating from the period 1610-1796. 

The GLOBALISE infrastructure will foster the writing of new, diverse and more representative histories based on the VOC archives. The project opens up the contents of the OBP by making available a full transcription of the text of the archival series, and identifying entities and events contained therein. This information is further contextualised with high-quality reference data and documentation, and will be made freely accessible from a user-friendly advanced research environment.


GLOBALISE is a project based at the Huygens Institute (KNAW Humanities Cluster) in the Netherlands funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) under grant no. 175.2019.003.
